| Dynamic Routes | HIGH | MED | Client Navigation |
| Server Data Fetching | HIGH | MED | Dynamic Routes |

**Deliverables:**
- `[id].tsx` and `[...slug].tsx` dynamic route patterns
- Route parameter extraction and typing
- Enhanced server component data fetching patterns
- Streaming data with Suspense integration

## **⚙️ Phase 4: Request Processing**  
**Request/response handling and configuration**

| Feature | Impact | Effort | Dependency |
|---------|--------|--------|------------|
| Middleware System | HIGH | MED | Phase 3 complete |
| Environment Variables | HIGH | LOW | None |

**Deliverables:**
- `middleware.ts` file support with request/response processing
- Authentication, redirects, and headers middleware
- `.env` file support with runtime/build-time variable separation
- Middleware matcher patterns for selective application

## **🏗️ Phase 5: Organization & API**
**Project organization and backend**

| Feature | Impact | Effort | Dependency |
|---------|--------|--------|------------|
| Route Groups | MED | LOW | Dynamic Routes |
| API Routes | HIGH | MED | Middleware |

**Deliverables:**
- `(folder)` route groups for organization without URL impact
- `/api` directory with HTTP method handlers
- Dynamic API routes with parameter extraction
- Integration with middleware system

## **🚀 Phase 6: Developer Experience**
**Development quality of life**

| Feature | Impact | Effort | Dependency |
|---------|--------|--------|------------|
| Hot Module Replacement | MED | HIGH | All core features |
| Error Handling | MED | MED | Core routing |

**Deliverables:**
- Fast Refresh for React components and server components
- Error boundaries with source maps and clear error messages
- Development error overlay
- Improved debugging tools

## **🎯 Strategic Goals**

### **Short-term (Phase 1-3): Core Framework**
- ✅ **Phase 1 Complete**: Established modern routing system with layouts and client navigation
- ✅ **Navigation System**: Complete @mfext/navigation package with RSC integration and layout persistence  
- **Phase 2 Target**: Package management and NPM publishing for wider adoption
- **Phase 3 Target**: Implement dynamic routing patterns that developers expect
- **Phase 3 Target**: Create seamless server-side data fetching with RSC integration

### **Medium-term (Phase 4-5): Full-Stack Framework**
- Add request/response processing for authentication and headers
- Complete API layer for backend functionality
- Provide organizational tools for large applications

### **Long-term (Phase 6): Production Ready**
- Optimize development experience with fast refresh and error handling
- Ensure framework is ready for production applications
- Match or exceed Next.js developer experience

## **🏗️ Implementation Notes**

### **Building on Existing Foundation**
MFExt already has several advantages:
- ✅ React Server Components with streaming
- ✅ TypeScript-first development
- ✅ Modern build system with Webpack
- ✅ Monorepo architecture

### **Key Technical Decisions**
- **Layout-first approach**: Layouts are fundamental to modern React applications
- **Client navigation priority**: Essential for SPA-like experience
- **Middleware integration**: Critical for production applications (auth, redirects, headers)
- **TypeScript native**: Framework assumes TypeScript usage from the start

### **Success Metrics**
- ✅ **Phase 1 Complete**: Framework provides working SPA experience with client-side navigation
- **Phase 1-3 Complete**: Framework can replace basic Next.js applications and is publicly available  
- **Phase 4-5 Complete**: Framework can handle production applications with auth and APIs
- **Phase 6 Complete**: Framework provides superior developer experience

## **🔄 Future Considerations**
*Features to consider after initial roadmap completion:*

- Static Site Generation (SSG) with `generateStaticParams`
- Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)
- Image optimization component
- Internationalization (i18n) support
- Performance monitoring and analytics
- Advanced caching strategies
- Deployment tooling and adapters

The development plan focuses on incremental delivery of Next.js-like functionality while maintaining modern RSC-first architecture.
