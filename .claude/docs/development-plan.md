# 🎯 **MFExt Framework Development Plan**

This document outlines the strategic development roadmap for evolving MFExt into a comprehensive Next.js-like React framework with modern React Server Components at its core.

## **✅ Phase 0: Foundation (Completed)**
**Modern React Server Components infrastructure**

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| React Server Components (RSC) | ✅ Complete | Streaming, client boundaries |
| Server-Side Rendering (SSR) | ✅ Complete | Traditional SSR with RSC proxy |
| Build System | ✅ Complete | Webpack with RSC/SSR/Client builds |
| CLI Tool | ✅ Complete | `mfext build` and `mfext start` |
| TypeScript Integration | ✅ Complete | Full TypeScript support |
| Monorepo Architecture | ✅ Complete | Core, config, and playground packages |

**What we have:** A solid foundation with modern RSC architecture, something that many frameworks are still working to achieve.

## **✅ Phase 1: UI Foundation (Completed)**
**Core user interface and navigation**

| Feature | Impact | Effort | Status |
|---------|--------|--------|---------|
| File-based Routing | HIGH | MED | ✅ Complete |
| Layout System | HIGH | HIGH | ✅ Complete |
| Client Navigation | HIGH | MED | ✅ Complete |

**Deliverables:**
- ✅ File-based routing system with `src/app/` directory structure
- ✅ `layout.tsx` files for shared UI components
- ✅ `<Link>` component with RSC integration (simplified API)
- ✅ `useRouter()` hook for programmatic navigation
- ✅ Nested layout support with persistence
- ✅ `@mfext/navigation` package with complete navigation system
- ✅ Event-driven navigation architecture with RSC Manager
- ✅ Unified server handling both SSR and RSC requests
- ✅ Framework-level NavigationProvider injection

## **🔀 Phase 2: Routing Enhancement**
**Advanced routing patterns**

| Feature | Impact | Effort | Dependency |
|---------|--------|--------|------------|
| Dynamic Routes | HIGH | MED | Client Navigation |
| Server Data Fetching | HIGH | MED | Dynamic Routes |

**Deliverables:**
- `[id].tsx` and `[...slug].tsx` dynamic route patterns
- Route parameter extraction and typing
- Enhanced server component data fetching patterns
- Streaming data with Suspense integration

## **⚙️ Phase 3: Request Processing**  
**Request/response handling and configuration**

| Feature | Impact | Effort | Dependency |
|---------|--------|--------|------------|
| Middleware System | HIGH | MED | Routing complete |
| Environment Variables | HIGH | LOW | None |

**Deliverables:**
- `middleware.ts` file support with request/response processing
- Authentication, redirects, and headers middleware
- `.env` file support with runtime/build-time variable separation
- Middleware matcher patterns for selective application

## **🏗️ Phase 4: Organization & API**
**Project organization and backend**

| Feature | Impact | Effort | Dependency |
|---------|--------|--------|------------|
| Route Groups | MED | LOW | Dynamic Routes |
| API Routes | HIGH | MED | Middleware |

**Deliverables:**
- `(folder)` route groups for organization without URL impact
- `/api` directory with HTTP method handlers
- Dynamic API routes with parameter extraction
- Integration with middleware system

## **🚀 Phase 5: Developer Experience**
**Development quality of life**

| Feature | Impact | Effort | Dependency |
|---------|--------|--------|------------|
| Hot Module Replacement | MED | HIGH | All core features |
| Error Handling | MED | MED | Core routing |

**Deliverables:**
- Fast Refresh for React components and server components
- Error boundaries with source maps and clear error messages
- Development error overlay
- Improved debugging tools

## **📋 Complete Phase Matrix**

| Phase Plan | Icon | Features | Total Effort | Dependencies | Deliverable |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Phase 0** | ✅ | RSC + SSR + File Routing | COMPLETED | - | Modern framework foundation |
| **Phase 1** | ✅ | Layout + Client Navigation + RSC Manager | COMPLETED | Phase 0 | Working SPA experience with navigation |
| **Phase 2** | 🔀 | Dynamic Routes + Server Fetching | MED + MED | Phase 1 | Full routing system |
| **Phase 3** | ⚙️ | Middleware + Env Variables | MED + LOW | Phase 2 | Request processing |
| **Phase 4** | 🏗️ | Route Groups + API Routes | LOW + MED | Phase 3 | Complete backend |
| **Phase 5** | 🚀 | HMR + Error Handling | HIGH + MED | Phase 4 | Production-ready DX |

## **🎯 Strategic Goals**

### **Short-term (Phase 1-2): Core Framework**
- ✅ **Phase 1 Complete**: Established modern routing system with layouts and client navigation
- ✅ **Navigation System**: Complete @mfext/navigation package with RSC integration and layout persistence  
- **Phase 2 Target**: Implement dynamic routing patterns that developers expect
- **Phase 2 Target**: Create seamless server-side data fetching with RSC integration

### **Medium-term (Phase 3-4): Full-Stack Framework**
- Add request/response processing for authentication and headers
- Complete API layer for backend functionality
- Provide organizational tools for large applications

### **Long-term (Phase 5): Production Ready**
- Optimize development experience with fast refresh and error handling
- Ensure framework is ready for production applications
- Match or exceed Next.js developer experience

## **🏗️ Implementation Notes**

### **Building on Existing Foundation**
MFExt already has several advantages:
- ✅ React Server Components with streaming
- ✅ TypeScript-first development
- ✅ Modern build system with Webpack
- ✅ Monorepo architecture

### **Key Technical Decisions**
- **Layout-first approach**: Layouts are fundamental to modern React applications
- **Client navigation priority**: Essential for SPA-like experience
- **Middleware integration**: Critical for production applications (auth, redirects, headers)
- **TypeScript native**: Framework assumes TypeScript usage from the start

### **Success Metrics**
- ✅ **Phase 1 Complete**: Framework provides working SPA experience with client-side navigation
- **Phase 1-2 Complete**: Framework can replace basic Next.js applications  
- **Phase 3-4 Complete**: Framework can handle production applications with auth and APIs
- **Phase 5 Complete**: Framework provides superior developer experience

## **🔄 Future Considerations**
*Features to consider after initial roadmap completion:*

- Static Site Generation (SSG) with `generateStaticParams`
- Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)
- Image optimization component
- Internationalization (i18n) support
- Performance monitoring and analytics
- Advanced caching strategies
- Deployment tooling and adapters

The development plan focuses on incremental delivery of Next.js-like functionality while maintaining modern RSC-first architecture.
