# Implementation Summary: Phase 2 - Package Management & Publishing

## Overview
**Phase 2** has been successfully completed with full package management and publishing setup. The MFExt framework packages are now properly structured and published to GitHub Packages registry with professional version management using Changesets.

## ✅ Completed Implementation

### Package Structure & Publishing Setup
- **Package Names**: Successfully implemented `@kyori-mfv/mfext-*` naming convention
  - `@kyori-mfv/mfext-core` - CLI tool and framework core
  - `@kyori-mfv/mfext-navigation` - React navigation components
  - `@kyori-mfv/mfext-config` - Shared configurations (ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript)
- **Registry Configuration**: All packages published to GitHub Packages (`npm.pkg.github.com`)
- **Package Types**: Properly differentiated CLI tool vs library packages

### Core Package Optimization
- **@kyori-mfv/mfext-core**: Configured as CLI-only package
  - Removed unnecessary library exports and build processes
  - Maintained `src/` directory structure for direct CLI execution
  - Proper `bin` field configuration pointing to `bin/cli.js`
  - Files field includes only necessary assets: `["bin", "src", "README.md"]`

### Library Package Configuration
- **@kyori-mfv/mfext-navigation**: Full library package with TypeScript declarations
  - Proper `exports` field for ESM/CJS compatibility
  - TypeScript build generating `.d.ts` files
  - React peer dependencies properly configured
- **@kyori-mfv/mfext-config**: Configuration package with multiple exports
  - ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript configurations
  - Proper export paths for different config types

### Professional Version Management
- **Changesets Integration**: Implemented professional version management system
  - Added `@changesets/cli` and `@changesets/changelog-github`
  - Configured `.changeset/config.json` with GitHub integration
  - Created standardized release workflow documentation
- **Release Scripts**: Added comprehensive pnpm scripts
  - `pnpm changeset` - Document changes
  - `pnpm bump` - Update package versions
  - `pnpm release` - Publish to GitHub Packages
  - `pnpm release:snapshot` - Create snapshot releases

### Registry & Authentication Setup
- **GitHub Packages Configuration**: 
  - Updated `.npmrc` with proper registry configuration
  - Set `@kyori-mfv:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com`
  - Configured authentication for publishing
- **Repository References**: All package.json files updated with correct repository URLs
- **Publishing Success**: All three packages successfully published to GitHub Packages

### Documentation Updates
- **Package READMEs**: Comprehensive documentation for all packages
  - Current status sections with publication information
  - API documentation with usage examples
  - Installation and integration guides
  - Changesets workflow documentation
- **Release Workflow**: Created `CHANGESETS.md` guide for version management
- **Integration Examples**: Updated all import statements and references

## Technical Implementation Details

### Package.json Configuration
```json
{
  "name": "@kyori-mfv/mfext-*",
  "publishConfig": {
    "registry": "https://npm.pkg.github.com"
  },
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "git+https://github.com/kyori-mfv/mfext.git"
  }
}
```

### Workspace Dependencies
- Maintained `workspace:*` dependencies for internal development
- Proper peer dependencies for external consumers
- Updated playground app to use correct package names

### Build System Integration
- Core package uses `src/` directory directly (should be builts to `dist/`)
- Navigation package builds to `dist/` with TypeScript declarations
- Config package exports raw configuration files

## Current Package Status

### Published Packages
- **@kyori-mfv/mfext-core@0.0.0** ✅ Published
- **@kyori-mfv/mfext-navigation@0.0.0** ✅ Published  
- **@kyori-mfv/mfext-config@0.0.0** ✅ Published

### Installation
```bash
# Configure registry (one-time setup)
npm config set @kyori-mfv:registry https://npm.pkg.github.com

# Install packages
pnpm add -D @kyori-mfv/mfext-core
pnpm add @kyori-mfv/mfext-navigation  
pnpm add -D @kyori-mfv/mfext-config
```

## Package Management
- Individual package.json files with proper dependencies and peer dependencies
- GitHub Packages publishing setup with successful package distribution
- Package versioning and release management with Changesets
- Comprehensive testing pipeline validation

## Framework Readiness
Phase 2 implementation has successfully transformed MFExt from an internal monorepo into a professionally packaged and distributed React framework. The packages are now:

- **Production Ready**: All packages published and accessible via GitHub Packages
- **Developer Friendly**: Comprehensive documentation and examples
- **Version Managed**: Professional release workflow with Changesets
- **Type Safe**: Full TypeScript support with declaration files
- **Framework Complete**: CLI tool, navigation system, and shared configurations

The framework is now ready for external adoption and community usage, with a solid foundation for future development phases.
