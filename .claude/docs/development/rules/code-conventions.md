# Code Conventions Rule

## Language Standards
- Follow JavaScript, Node.js, and React.js coding conventions
- Prefer TypeScript over JavaScript for all purposes when possible
- Use TypeScript for type safety and better development experience

## Architecture Principles
- Core package should only focus on build tools and server functionality
- Create separate packages for specific purpose components (similar to Next.js approach)
- Maintain clear separation of concerns between packages

## General Principles
- Follow existing code style and patterns in the codebase
- Maintain consistency with surrounding code
- Use established libraries and utilities already present in the project
