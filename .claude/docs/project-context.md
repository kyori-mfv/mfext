# MFExt Project Context

## Project Overview

**MFExt** is a full-stack React framework with built-in React Server Components (RSC) and Server-Side Rendering (SSR) support, similar to Next.js but with a focus on modern architecture and development experience.

## Architecture

### Monorepo Structure
- `packages/core/` - Framework implementation and CLI tool
- `packages/config/` - Shared configurations (ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript)
- `apps/playground/` - Example application using the framework

## Current Status

Active development with basic RSC/SSR functionality, file-based routing, and CLI tools implemented.
